Book Recommendation System using Python

This project implements Book Recommendation System using 2 different methods:

a) Collaborative Filtering
b) K Means with Cuckoo Search

The user gives the name of a book as an input and the system recommends top 5 books to the user based on user ratings. This project 
compares the widely used method Collaborative Filtering with a lesser know method known as K Means with Cuckoo Search.

The books dataset used is the goodreads books dataset.
